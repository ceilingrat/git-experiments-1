[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/UeU6mjyLSAWul_xzx2ymZw/badge)](https://hackmd.io/UeU6mjyLSAWul_xzx2ymZw) [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/ceilingrat/git-experiments-1)](https://repl.it/github/ceilingrat/git-experiments-1)

I will be reading through the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and whenever I encounter something that I want to test out, I will use [this repl](https://replit.com/@ceilingrat/git-experiments-1) as my test environment.

In this repository, I will store both the files that I used and journal entries to accompany these files and capture any important lessons learned from my experiments.
